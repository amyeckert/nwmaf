        <h2>What is Empowerment Self-Defense?</h2>

        <p>Empowerment Self-Defense (ESD) teaches practical skills<sup><a href="#footnote-1" class="footnote__label" id="footnote-ref-1" aria-describedby="footnote-container-label" data-reference="1"><span class="sr-only">Link to footnote</span></a></sup> to those targeted for gender-based violence—primarily women, LGBTQIA+ people, and non-binary people. These skills help people avoid, interrupt, respond to, and heal from interpersonal violence.</p>

        <p>We teach those skills in the context of rape culture, addressing the physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and sociocultural components of advocating for and protecting yourself and others.</p>

        <p>ESD is grounded in an understanding of social inequality and social justice, and it addresses the whole spectrum of gender-based violence, from harassment to attack, from microaggressions to trafficking.</p>
        <div class="p-5 mb-5 mt-5 bg-blue text-white">
            <h3 class="text-white mb-0">ESD is anything we think, say, or do that helps us feel safe, strong, and respected.</h3>
        </div>

        <h3>Core elements of an ESD program</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>We know that trauma survivors are in every room, <em>and we teach with awareness of how trauma affects people.</em></li>
            <li>We reject victim-blaming and honor anything anyone has done or is doing to survive.</li>
            <li>We focus a lot on harassment, abuse, and assault by people we know, <em>as that’s most common.</em></li>
            <li>We use and model consent throughout the class</li>
            <li>We focus and build on students' strengths, not weaknesses</li>
            <li>We teach a toolbox of skills - physical, verbal, emotional—against a range of assaults ranging from irritating to
            life-threatening:
                <ul>
                    <li>assertive communication skills that can be used to interrupt all levels of violations</li>
                    <li>physical techniques that are simple, quick to learn, and easy to remember, and that people of different ages, sizes, and
                    abilities can do</li>
                    <li>awareness of trauma responses to reduce self blame and encourage healing and action</li>
                    <li>techniques to manage adrenaline and activation under stress</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <div class="p-5 mb-5 mt-5 bg-grey--lighter">
            <h3>Tools not rules</h3>
            <p>We know that whatever someone decides to do in each situation, whatever action they do or don’t take, they aren’t at fault. The responsibility lies 100% with the aggressor.</p>
            <p>We don’t tell anyone what they should or shouldn’t do. We recognize that there are many ways to defend oneself, and we respect everyone’s decision to get through or survive the best way they can.<p>

            <h3>It Works</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">The most profound testimony about the transformative power of ESD training is what our students say. They
            tell us how life-changing ESD training has been for them: they are more able to speak up for themselves,
            less likely to blame themselves for harassment, abuse, and assault; are more confident and less fearful;
            know themselves better, trust themselves more, have healthier relationships, and are more able to create the
            lives they want.</p>
