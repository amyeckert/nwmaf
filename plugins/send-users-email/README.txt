== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I select individual users? =

Absolutely. Go to `Email Users` page of plugin and select user you want to send email to.

= Can I choose multiple roles? =

Yes. You are able to choose one or many roles at a time and send email.

= When is email send? =

Emails are processed immediately and there is no delay. However, depending on your hosting or mail service provides, there might be slight delay in delivery. Pro version however has option to send emails via queue.

= I am using Gmail as email service provider (or any other provider) and user are not getting emails. =

This plugin only acts as a bridge between your site and email service provider. Its upto email provider to deliver or block sent emails. If your delivery is not consistent, please contact your email provider support or hosting to see if you are hitting their limit. Plugin does attempt to let you know when your email are not sent. If this happens, please check your logs or email service provider usage for any issues.

= I have many users in my system and many are not getting the emails? =

Since, processing is happening immediately, low `max execution time` in PHP setting might terminate the process. Try increasing the max execution time. For Pro version of the plugin, you can avoid this issue by adding your emails to queue so that they are sent gradually with help of cron.

= I have an issue/question/suggestion/request? =

Please post your issue/question/suggestion/request to support forum. I will try and address it as soon as possible.


= Is there a way to try out the plugin before I install it on my website? =

Absolutely. Try it out at [https://tastewp.org/plugins/send-users-email/](https://tastewp.org/plugins/send-users-email/). Please note that this service doesn't allow outgoing email so you will just be trying out the interface and general idea of the features.
